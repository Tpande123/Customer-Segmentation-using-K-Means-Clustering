# Introduction: -

Creating a clustering model to divide customers visiting a Mall into different clusters using K-Means Cluastering algorithm and deciding the optimum number of clusters to divide the customers into by making use of WCSS (Within Clusters Sum of Squares) method and the elbow graph.
This is an Unsupervised Machine Learning Problem.
The different steps involved are  -> 

1.) Importing the Dependencies.

2.) Data Processing and Data Analysis.

3.) Deciding the number of clusters using WCSS (Within CLusters Sum of Squares) method and the elbow graph.

4.) Training the K-Means Clustering model in order to divide the custmers into the different clusters.

5.) Visualizing the Clusters created by K-Means Clustering model.


## Prerequirements for the code file: -

1.) Jupyter Notebook or google collab.

2.) Mall_Customers.csv provided with this repository.


## How to run the code: -

1.) Open the jupyter notebook terminal(or upload and open in google collab) 

2.) Navigate to the folder where the zip file is extracted to and open the respective .ipynb file provided in their respective folder. The code and the output to that code will be visible.

3.) To rerun the whole notebook again, press kernel and press Restart and run all. (For jupyter notebook users)
